Module 2, Task 3 (Lecture)

# Can Place Flowers

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

## Example

- Input: `flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`, `n=1`
- Output: `true`

## Constraints

- `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`
- There are no adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`
- `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

```py
def foo() {
    print("Hello World")
}
```

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

```js
console.log("Hello, World!")
```
