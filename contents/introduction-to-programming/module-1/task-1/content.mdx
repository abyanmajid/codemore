Module 1, Task 1 (Lecture)

# Welcome!

Welcome to the world of programming! We will cover a LOT in this course - from programming fundamentals, to error handling, design patterns, and even best practices and conventions! 

### The Goal

I want you to leave this course as someone who, not only knows how to write code, but also someone who is principled and has a mental model for problem solving with code - such that you would be able to extrapolate what you have learned in this course to other areas of programming!

### Google-Fu

Often, a lecture will not give you enough information to do an assignment - and there is a good reason for this! In the real world, a programmer will discover a wide variety of problem specifications, bugs, and, with the fast-growing industry, unfamiliar new concepts! So, I want to help you master the art of googling!

### Course limitations

As of v0.2.0, codemore.io's web-based text editor does NOT support user inputs and loading files. Nevertheless, there will still be modules on these important topics, but you would have to have to set up a development environment to follow along.

Alright, enough of my blabbering... Let's get started with your first ever line of code!
