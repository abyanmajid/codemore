# Variables, Data Types, and Memory

## Declaration and Assignment

You can think of variables as containers that hold data. In python, you can create a variable by declaring and assigning to it some value:

```py
x = "Can I have"
y = 5
z = "cookies please? :D"
print(x, y, z) # This outputs: Can I have 5 tacos please? :D
```

During assignment, the variable to which the data will be assigned to is always to the left of `=`. So a line such as `5 = x` is not valid code and will cause an error.

*Aside 1:* The `#` symbol tells the python interpreter that every character that follows it on that line is a comment. Comments are annotations within code that are not executed by the interpreter.

*Aside 2:* `print` can take multiple values and they will print each of them separated by an empty space! We will come back to this on a later module when we would talk about functions.

It's important to note that `=` denotes assignment, not equality! We are essentially telling the python interpreter to assign `5` as the value of `x`. To further illustrate this, take a look at the following snippet:

```py
x = 5
y = 10
x = y
```

At the end of the script, we have `x = 10` and `y = 10` because `x = y` is not asserting that `x` is equal to `y`, but rather that `y` is assigned to be the value of `x`

### Memory allocation

At a lower level, when we assign a value to a variable, say `x = 5`, Python allocates memory in the computer's RAM to store `5` at a unique location represented by some address. The variable `x` then serves as a pointer to that memory address where `5` is stored.  

## Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data in programming, typically predefined by the language and provide the simplest forms of data representation. In python, there are 4 built-in primitive data types which are (1) integer, (2) float, (3) boolean, and (4) string.

### Integer

Integers are whole numbers. They can be positive, negative, or zero.

```py
a = 10
b = -3
c = 0
```

Under the hood, integers are stored in memory as a sequence of bytes. The actual representation depends on the underlying computer architecture (e.g., 64 bit, 32 bit, 8 bit, etc...)

#### Encoding and Storing Integers (Extension)

An integer can be represented in binary. To do this, you repeatedly divide the number by 2, recording the remainder at each step until the quotient is zero. The remainders, read in reverse order, form the binary equivalent of the decimal number. As an example, let us encode the number 13 in binary,

$$13\div 2 = 6 + 1$$
$$6\div 2 = 3 + 0$$
$$3\div 2 = 1 + 1$$
$$1\div 2 = 0 + 1$$

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we can conclude 13 in decimal is 1101 in binary. As a general rule, the ranges for encoding integers in an $n$-bit architecture are as follows:

- Unsigned integers go from $0$ to $2^n - 1$
- Signed integers go from $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1}-1$

So if we have an 8-bit architecture (where each memory cell can store 8 bits of information), the number 300 will occupy two memory cells because one cell can only store unsigned integers up to $2^8 - 1 = 255$.

### Float

Floats are numbers with a f

### Boolean

### String

## Type Casting

## Static vs. Dynamic Typing

You can also declare a variable without assigning any value to it. This is done by annotating a type for the variable:

```py
x: int # declaration
print(x) # this causes an error
x = 5 # assignment
```

In the above snippet, we declared `x` to be a variable of type `int` (short for integer) without assigning to it any value, and we cannot use `x` until we assign to it some value! You should know that Python is a **dynamically typed** language, which means that the types of your variables are inferred by the interpreter at runtime (when you run your script). On the other hand, languages like Java are **statically typed**, which means all variables must be annotated a type. Being a **dynamically typed** language, there is generally no reason to declare variables without assignment in Python.
